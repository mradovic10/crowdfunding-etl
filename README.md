# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

For this project, we were tasked with creating an ETL pipeline. First, data was extracted from two Excel files. Then, that data was cleaned and transformed using Pandas and regular expressions into a cohesive units. Four CSV files were created and were used to create an entity relationship diagram and a table schema. Lastly, the CSV files were imported into our PostgreSQL database.

The repository contains: (1) a Jupyter notebook file that contains the Extract and Transform portions of the pipeline; (2) a PNG file of the ERD; (3) a SQL file with the table schema; and (4) a Resources folder that contains the two original Excel files and the four CSV files that were created.
